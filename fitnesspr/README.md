## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Trainers
- Standard email/password authentication
- Full access to trainer dashboard and all features

### Clients
- PIN-based authentication (4-6 digit codes)
- Access limited to personal profile and assigned content
- No registration required - PINs generated by trainers

## 🎨 Design System

Built with a consistent design system using:
- **Colors**: Tailwind CSS color palette
- **Typography**: Geist font family
- **Components**: shadcn/ui + custom fitness-specific components
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design approach
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliance

## 📊 Core Workflows

1. **Client Onboarding**: Trainer creates profile → generates PIN → client access
2. **Program Creation**: Design workouts → assign to clients → track progress
3. **Meal Planning**: Create recipes → build meal plans → client feedback
4. **Session Management**: Set availability → client booking → payment processing
5. **Progress Tracking**: Client updates → trainer analysis → plan adjustments

## 🔧 Development

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

### Type Safety
All API routes and database operations are fully typed with TypeScript.

### Testing

npm run test          # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end tests with Playwright
```

### Build
```bash
